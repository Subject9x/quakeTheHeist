# Quake:TheHeist
Ranger's looking for some 5-finger-discounts at Shub's house o' Runes,
just a 'small mod' kind of project for QuakeC, the idea is to incorporate heist mechanics from other games into Quake for a fun co-op experience.

### .plan?
+ a modular code base that should be friendly to other mods, something like "just include /heist/ files".
+ something playable eventually.

### features
+ 'Heist' items - when carried they reduce player speed and take player weapon away.
+ throwable items - items can be picked up / put down.
+ new monster flags and triggers to react to things being stolen.
+ new map triggers to support 'heist-style' maps.
+ time-gate intereactions - 'hold-button-down'
+ limited HUD changes just to support mechanics.

that's about it, the mantra is 'lightweight' so that modders can easily bring the fun into their own projects.
